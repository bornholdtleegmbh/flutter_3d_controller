# Flutter 3D Controller

The most complete Flutter package for rendering interactive 3D models in various formats (**GLB**, **GLTF**, **OBJ**, **FBX**), with the ability to control animations, textures, camera, and more.

# Why Flutter 3D Controller?

The ***Flutter 3D Controller*** package is the most comprehensive solution for rendering various 3D model formats, offering extensive functionality to give users optimal control over 3D models.

It leads in implementing new features, while **some other packages have just copied Flutter 3D Controller's features and code** without proper credit or adherence to licensing.

Notably, when testing **other available packages**, users may experience **gesture malfunctions** on iOS and certain Android devices. However, **Flutter 3D Controller** is the first and only package to **resolve this issue** with its **gesture interceptor feature**, introduced in **version 2.0.0**, released on **October 5, 2024**.

## Brief Examples

## How to use controller
```dart
//Create controller object to control 3D model.
Flutter3DController controller = Flutter3DController();

//Listen to model loading state via controller
controller.onModelLoaded.addListener(() {
  debugPrint('model is loaded : ${controller.onModelLoaded.value}');
});

//It will play 3D model animation, you can use it to play or switch between animations.
controller.playAnimation();

//If you pass specific animation name it will play that specific animation.
//If you pass null and your model has at least 1 animation it will play first animation.
controller.playAnimation(animationName: chosenAnimation);

//If you pass loopCount > 0, the animation will repeat for the specified number of times.
//To play the animation only once, set loopCount to 1.
controller.playAnimation(loopCount: 1);

//The loopCount argument can also be used with a specific animation.
controller.playAnimation(loopCount: 2, animationName: chosenAnimation);

//It will pause the animation at current frame.
controller.pauseAnimation();

//It will resume the animation from the current frame (where it was paused).
//This continues the animation from exactly where it was paused,
//unlike resetAnimation() which starts from the beginning.
controller.resumeAnimation();

//Get the current animation time in seconds
double currentTime = await controller.getCurrentAnimationTime();

//It will reset and play animation from first frame (from beginning).
controller.resetAnimation();

//It will stop the animation.
controller.stopAnimation();

//It will return available animation list of 3D model.
await controller.getAvailableAnimations();

//It will load desired texture of 3D model, you need to pass texture name.
controller.setTexture(textureName: chosenTexture);

//It will return available textures list of 3D model.
await controller.getAvailableTextures();

//It will set your desired camera target.
controller.setCameraTarget(0.3, 0.2, 0.4);

//It will reset the camera target to default.
controller.resetCameraTarget();

//It will set your desired camera orbit.
controller.setCameraOrbit(20, 20, 5);

//It will reset the camera orbit to default.
controller.resetCameraOrbit();
```

## How to load glb and gltf models
```dart
//The 3D viewer widget for glb and gltf format
Flutter3DViewer(
    //If you pass 'true' the flutter_3d_controller will add gesture interceptor layer
    //to prevent gesture recognizers from malfunctioning on iOS and some Android devices.
    //the default value is true
    activeGestureInterceptor: true,
    //If you don't pass progressBarColor, the color of defaultLoadingProgressBar will be grey.
    //You can set your custom color or use [Colors.transparent] for hiding loadingProgressBar.
    progressBarColor: Colors.orange,
    //You can disable viewer touch response by setting 'enableTouch' to 'false'
    enableTouch: true,
    //This callBack will return the loading progress value between 0 and 1.0
    onProgress: (double progressValue) {
      debugPrint('model loading progress : $progressValue');
    },
    //This callBack will call after model loaded successfully and will return model address
    onLoad: (String modelAddress) {
      debugPrint('model loaded : $modelAddress');
    },
    //this callBack will call when model failed to load and will return failure error
    onError: (String error) {
      debugPrint('model failed to load : $error');
    },
    //You can have full control of 3d model animations, textures and camera
    controller: controller,
    src: 'assets/business_man.glb', //3D model with different animations
    //src: 'assets/sheen_chair.glb', //3D model with different textures
    //src: 'https://modelviewer.dev/shared-assets/models/Astronaut.glb', // 3D model from URL
)
```

## How to load obj models
```dart
//The 3D viewer widget for obj format
Flutter3DViewer.obj(
    src: 'assets/flutter_dash.obj',
    //src: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-r-davari/content-holder/refs/heads/master/flutter_3d_controller/flutter_dash_model/flutter_dash.obj',
    scale: 5,
    // Initial scale of obj model
    cameraX: 0,
    // Initial cameraX position of obj model
    cameraY: 0,
    //Initial cameraY position of obj model
    cameraZ: 10,
    //Initial cameraZ position of obj model
    //This callBack will return the loading progress value between 0 and 1.0
    onProgress: (double progressValue) {
      debugPrint('model loading progress : $progressValue');
    },
    //This callBack will call after model loaded successfully and will return model address
    onLoad: (String modelAddress) {
      debugPrint('model loaded : $modelAddress');
    },
    //this callBack will call when model failed to load and will return failure erro
    onError: (String error) {
      debugPrint('model failed to load : $error');
    },
)
```

</head>
```

### `Outgoing Connections(Client)` (macOS only)

For loading 3D models in *macOS* you need to configure the macOS App Sandbox by *enabling* the `Outgoing Connections (Client)` option in your `MacOS` XCode Project, under `Runner > Signing & Capabilities`.

### `AppDelegate.html` (macOS only)

Add the following codes to your macOS `AppDelegate` file to support transparent background for *flutter_3d_controller*

```swift
import flutter_inappwebview_macos

extension InAppWebView {
    @objc public override func viewDidMoveToWindow() {
        super.viewDidMoveToWindow()
        
        if window != nil {
            print("InAppWebView moved to window, enforcing transparency")
            self.setValue(false, forKey: "opaque")
            self.setValue(false, forKey: "drawsBackground")
            self.layer?.backgroundColor = NSColor.clear.cgColor
        }
    }
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions
- **Desktop(macOS) rare issues** : You may experience unexpected issues in desktop(macOS) beta version.
- **The 3D model could not load** : First check the example, if models in examples loads, may be there is problem with your model or your model path.
- **The animation list could not be retrieved** : Check if there are any special characters in the animation names that might cause a JSON encoding error.
- **The 3D model could not load from url** : It might be due to [CORS] security restrictions. The server hosting the model file *must* send appropriate CORS response headers for viewer to be able to load the file. See [google/model-viewer#1015](https://github.com/google/model-viewer/issues/1015)


## More Info
This package uses Google's [model-viewer](https://modelviewer.dev) to render 3D models and it may have some issue in rendering some models/textures, the core of package (Model Viewer) will change in future to support all type of 3D models.
